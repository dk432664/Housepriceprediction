# Sentiment In Text

This exercise is the encoding of a particular word and store them into matrix It uses Api like Tokenizer ,pad_sequence and when a data is provided in list It maps the sentences and the common word in sentences when entered 2 or more times will get the same encoded number 
otherwise if we test the data that is not mentioned in  num_words we give them special treatement by assigning  token to that word so that whenever other words are stored they are represented by special token
