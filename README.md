# Housepriceprediction
if house pricing was as easy as a house costs 100k + 50k per bedroom, so that a 1 bedroom house costs 150k, a 2 bedroom house costs 200k etc
we have to predict the cost of 10bedroom house
by creating a neural network so that it learns the relations and predict the cost of 10 bedroom house
using linear relation between x and y


# Handwriting Recognization problem
In the problem we are provided the dataset with label digit from 0 t0 9
we have to predict how accurate it is in predicting the img of the digit
and the losses held on each epochs while training the data
